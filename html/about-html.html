            <h2>HTML History</h2>
            <p>
              HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not
              officially released. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML
              4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing
                information that can be readable and accessible via web
                browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in
                creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the
                features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which
                remained the standard markup language for designing and creating
                websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of
                HTML.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper
                or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML,
                giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing
                web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed
                down the browser in applying further improvements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful
                version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and
                used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of
                HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.

            <h2>More about HyperText Markup Language</h2>
            <p>
              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block
              of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
              Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a
              web page's appearance/presentation (<abbr
                title="Cascading Style Sheets"
                >CSS</abbr
              >) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
              either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
              fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the
              Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you
              become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
              display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements"
              such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;header&gt;,
              &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;p&gt;,
              &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;,
              &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;canvas&gt;, &lt;datalist&gt;, &lt;details&gt;,
              &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;output&gt;, &lt;progress&gt;,
              &lt;video&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt; and many others.
            </p>
            <p>Here we can see a basic HTML file structure:</p>
            <div class="code-snippet">
              <code>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang="en"&gt; &lt;head&gt;
